#CAROUSEL

It's a project for my training, the object is to make a carousel in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

There are two versions: a simple carousel or a complicated carousel.

The simple version:  
- make a carousel that scrolls images regardless of the number of images  
- when the carousel arrives at the last image, it comes back to the beginning  

The complicated version:  
- each image is accompanied by a small description  
- add buttons to move forward or back in the carousel  

I did the complicated carousel.
